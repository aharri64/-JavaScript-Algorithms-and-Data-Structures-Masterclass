# ITERATION & RECURSION

## OBJECTIVES

-   Define what recursion is and how it can be used
-   Understand the two essential components of a recursive function
-   Visualize the call stack to better debug and understand recursive functions
    Use helper method recursion and pure recursion to solve more difficult problems.

### What is recursion?

A **process** (a function in our case) that **calls itself**

## Why do I need to know this?

1. It's everywhere
    - JSON.parse/JSON.stringify
    - document.getElementsById and DOM traversal algorithms
    - object traversal
    - It's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration
2. It becomes very important in more advanced algorithms
