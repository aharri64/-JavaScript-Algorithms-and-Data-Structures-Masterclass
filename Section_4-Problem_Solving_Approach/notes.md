# Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns

[Slides](https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/problem-solving-patterns)

## OBJECTIVES

- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

## Step 1: Understand the problem

### WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?

    A **process** or **set of steps** to accomplish a certain task.

### Why do I need to know this?

Almost **everything** that you do in programming involves some kind of **algorithm!**

**It's the <u>foundation</u> for being a successful problem solving and developer**

Also...

**_INTERVIEWS_**

### HOW DO YOU IMPROVE?

1. **Devise** a plan for solving problems
2. **Master** common problem solving patterns

### PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGIES

##### A SIMPLE, FOOLPROOF, MAGICAL, MIRACULOUS, FAIL-SAFE APPROACH

### PROBLEM SOLVING

- Understand the Problem
- Explore Concrete Examples
- Break It Down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look Back and Refactor

Note: many of these strategies are adapted from George Polya, whose book _How To Solve It_ is a great resource for anyone who wants to become a better problem solver

### UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

### Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
   - "implement addition"
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
   - ints?
   - floats?
   - what about string for large numbers
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
   - int? float? string?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
